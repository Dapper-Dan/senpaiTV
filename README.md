A mock anime streaming platform that unifies discovery, watch tracking, and streaming experience in a single sleek app. SenpaiTV simulates what Crunchyroll *should* feel like ‚Äî clean, customizable, and fully integrated with your anime tracker.

---

## Overview

**SenpaiTV** is a fictional streaming service that mimics real anime platforms like Crunchyroll, Netflix, and HIDIVE. It hosts trailers or mock content in place of full episodes, while integrating directly with **AniList** and **MyAnimeList** to manage your real watch progress and lists.

Instead of linking users out, SenpaiTV offers simulated platform access through a mock authentication flow ‚Äî creating a unified, immersive viewing experience with zero API limitations or legal friction.

## Problems It Solves

- Anime is scattered across streaming platforms
- Users juggle multiple services + tracker sites
- Crunchyroll‚Äôs UX is cluttered, MyAnimeList is outdated
- There's no single place to browse, queue, and track across platforms
